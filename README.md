#Python
Competition scripts

#
In the directory "MCM-ICM"

There are some python scripts which scrape some 
information, like city name, latitude and longitude 
about each public road's start place and end.

I scraping data from wikipedia about two countries' main public road
Ireland & America

The scripts and the data I scraped are in the subdirectories named 
"Ire_py_data" & "USA_py_data"

#
In the directory "Service-outsource"

There are some python scripts which can recognize some simple "Captcha"

I put an original picture and one after preprocessing, so you can see the difference

With the scripts named "use_ocr.py", you can compute the operation in the picture 
and the rate of accuracy can reach higher than 70%.
